Clusters are a partitioning of individuals into smaller groups of similar
individuals. In other words a clusters is a slice of slices containing
individuals. The similarity depends on a metric defined elsewhere. The
purpose of a partinioning individuals is to apply genetic operators inside a
cluster. In biological terms this encourages "incest" and maintains isolated
species.
