# Grid variant of the travelling salesman problem

Solving the TSP with a grid configuration is useful for benchmarking GAs. Indeed, the optimal solution for a grid of size *n* is (*n*-1)x(*n*-1). Thus we can measure how a GA is from the best solution.

Running the code produces the following GIF, showing the progress of the best solution found by the GA through time.
